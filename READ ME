This code defines a Mongoose schema and model for a `Product`. Here's a brief explanation:

1. **Import Mongoose**: Mongoose is imported to interact with MongoDB.

2. **Define Product Schema**: The `productSchema` outlines the structure of `Product` documents:
   - `title`: Required string, trimmed.
   - `price`: Required number, minimum value 0.
   - `category`: Required string, trimmed.
   - `inStock`: Boolean, defaults to `true`.

3. **Create Product Model**: A `Product` model is created using `mongoose.model` based on the schema. This model represents the `products` collection in MongoDB and allows CRUD operations.

4. **Export Model**: The `Product` model is exported for use in other parts of the application.

This code effectively sets up a `Product` structure in MongoDB and provides the necessary model to interact with it.
